## 🔍 D. Event Matching Logic

**When an event is posted**, the system does:

1. **Skill Match**  
   Match service types required (e.g. “guitarist”, “MC”, “DJ”)

2. **Location Proximity**  
   Use real-time location + radius (e.g. "within 10km")

3. **Availability Check**  
   Based on provider’s calendar and availability status

4. **Rating Priority**  
   Prioritize high-rated and verified service providers

5. **Competency Level**  
   Filter based on experience level (e.g., Beginner, Pro, Expert)

6. **AI Match Boost (Pro Users)**  
   Paid users appear higher in AI suggestions
